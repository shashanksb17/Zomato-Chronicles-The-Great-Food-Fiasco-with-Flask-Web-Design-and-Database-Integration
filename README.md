4. **Updating Order Status**: Staff members can update the status of an order through the "Order Management" section. They enter the order ID and select the new status from the available options.

5. **Reviewing Orders**: Staff members can review all orders through the "Order Management" section. The application presents a comprehensive list of orders, including customer names, dish details, and current statuses.

6. **Exiting Operations**: Staff members can conclude the day's operations by selecting the "Exit" option in the web application. This ensures proper closure and data management.

The application provides intuitive forms, dialogs, and interfaces for users to interact with the system efficiently.

## Taking Orders <a name="taking-orders"></a>

The "Taking Orders" feature allows staff members to receive customer orders

and process them seamlessly. Here's how it works:

1. Staff members access the "Place Order" section of the web application.

2. The application presents a form where staff members can enter the customer's name and the dish IDs for the order.

3. Upon submitting the form, the application verifies the availability of each dish in the order. If a dish is unavailable, an error message is displayed, and the order cannot be placed.

4. If all dishes are available, the application generates a unique order ID for the order and sets the initial order status as "received."

5. The order details, including the customer name, dish IDs, order ID, and initial status, are stored in the database for future reference.

6. The staff member receives confirmation of the successful order placement.

The application ensures that orders are processed accurately, and the availability of dishes is checked in real-time to avoid inconsistencies.

## Order Updates <a name="order-updates"></a>

The "Order Updates" feature allows staff members to update the status of an order as it progresses through different stages. Here's how it works:

1. Staff members access the "Order Management" section of the web application.

2. The application presents a list of orders, including the customer name, dish details, and current status.

3. To update the status of an order, staff members enter the order ID and select the new status from the available options (e.g., "preparing," "ready for pickup," "delivered").

4. Upon updating the status, the application updates the order's status in the database and reflects the changes in real-time.

5. Customers can view the updated order status on their end without having to refresh the page.

The order update feature enables staff members to manage and track the progress of each order effectively.

## Edge Case Handling <a name="edge-case-handling"></a>

The Zomato Chronicles web application handles various edge cases to ensure smooth operations and provide a user-friendly experience. Here are some examples of edge cases and how they are handled:

1. **Ordering Unavailable Dishes**: If a customer attempts to order a dish that is not available, the application detects this and displays an error message. The customer is informed that the dish is currently unavailable and prompted to choose an alternative dish.

2. **Ordering Non-existent Dishes**: If a customer provides a dish ID that does not exist in the menu, the application detects this and displays an error message. The customer is prompted to enter a valid dish ID.

3. **Invalid Form Submissions**: When staff members submit forms with missing or invalid information, the application validates the form fields and displays appropriate error messages. The staff members are guided to correct the errors before proceeding.

4. **Error Handling**: The application handles server errors, database connection issues, and other unexpected scenarios gracefully. Error messages are displayed to users, and appropriate actions are taken to ensure data integrity.

By handling edge cases diligently, the application enhances the overall user experience and minimizes potential errors.

## Real-time Order Status Updates <a name="real-time-order-status-updates"></a>

The Zomato Chronicles web application employs WebSockets to provide real-time updates of order statuses to customers. Here's how it works:

1. Whenever the status of an order changes (e.g., from "preparing" to "ready for pickup"), the application triggers an event to update the order status.

2. The server-side application emits a WebSocket event with the updated order status and the corresponding order ID.

3. The client-side application, which is connected to the WebSocket server, receives the event and updates the order status displayed on the customer's page without requiring a page refresh.

4. This real-time update mechanism allows customers to track the progress of their orders seamlessly and provides an interactive user experience.

The real-time order status updates feature enhances communication between staff members and customers and ensures transparency in the order fulfillment process.

## Chatbot Assistance <a name="chatbot-assistance"></a>

The Zomato Chronicles web application integrates a text-based chatbot to provide round-the-clock customer service and address common queries. Here's how it works:

1. Customers can access the chatbot interface on the website at any time.

2. Customers can enter their questions or queries in natural language, such as "What are your hours of operation?" or "What is the status of my order?"

3. The chatbot analyzes the user input and responds accordingly. It can provide information about hours of operation, order status, popular dishes, and more.

4. The chatbot can also handle custom queries by utilizing a natural language processing (NLP) model or by redirecting the query to a human representative if necessary.

5. The chatbot's responses are displayed in the chatlog interface, providing real-time assistance to customers.

The chatbot assistance feature enhances customer service by providing instant responses to common queries and freeing up staff members to focus on more complex issues.

## Customer Feedback System <a name="customer-feedback-system"></a>

The Zomato Chronicles web application incorporates a customer feedback system to gather ratings and reviews for orders. Here's how it works:

1. After customers receive their orders, they have the option to rate and review their experience.

2. Customers can provide ratings on a predefined scale (e.g., 1-5 stars) and leave a text review if desired.

3. The application stores the ratings and reviews in the database, associating them with the respective orders and dishes.

4. The average rating for each dish is calculated based on the received ratings.

5. The application displays the average rating and customer reviews next to each dish on the menu page, allowing potential customers to make informed decisions.

6. The feedback system aids in quality control by identifying consistently poor-rated dishes that may require attention.

7. If the feedback system is integrated with user accounts, the data can be utilized to enhance the recommendation system by suggesting dishes highly rated by users with similar preferences.

The customer feedback system promotes transparency, enables quality assessment, and provides valuable information for potential customers.
